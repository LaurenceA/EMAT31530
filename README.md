## Course Materials:
Course materials for each week will be posted here on Monday.  Course materials each week will include some combination of:
* There is _always_ extensive pdf notes.
* The pdf notes will _usually, but not always_ include questions.
* All questions will have worked answers.
* There will _usually, but not always_ be iPython notebooks (which are examinable), discussing practical aspects of training neural networks.
* These iPython notebooks _occasionally_ have exercises.
* The concepts in the iPython notebooks are examinable.
* There will be videos of me going through the material in the pdf notes.  Where appropriate there _may_ also be videos of me going through the iPython notebooks.  These videos won't add anything to the underlying notes/notebooks.  So if you read + understand the notes / notebooks, the videos are optional.
 
## Feedback: 
* The main route for feedback is the labs/problem classes on Fridays 11-1 in MVB 1.11.  *These labs/problem classes are the primary route for feedback on all aspects of the course, including lectures, notes, questions, iPython notebooks, and past exams!!!!*

## Exam
* Christmas exam format is not yet nailed down.  I will announce as soon as details are available.
* Things have changed quite alot since last year, so previous EMAT31530 exams are no longer relevant.
* I will post a practice exam once details are available.
* The exam will focus on the _concepts_ rather than specific math equations / PyTorch functions.  So focus on understanding the underlying concepts, and don't worry too much about very low-level details.  I will give more guidance once the practice exam is available.

## Group coursework:
There will be a group coursework in TB2, which will run roughly for the first half of the teaching block.  Details are again not yet nailed down, and I will announce as soon as information is available.
