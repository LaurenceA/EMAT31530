# EMAT31530: Introduction to AI
The course will introduce AI, with a focus on neural networks in PyTorch.

## Teaching Block Structure
* This course runs across TB1 + TB2.
* TB1: all the teaching happens in TB1.
* TB2: there is a group project in the first half of TB2.
* Don't be surprised if the course ends up taking more time in TB1!

## Course Materials for TB1:
Course materials for each week will be posted here on Monday.  Course materials each week will include some combination of:
* There is _always_ extensive pdf notes.
* The pdf notes will _usually, but not always_ include questions.
* All questions will have worked answers.
* There will _usually, but not always_ be iPython notebooks (which are examinable), discussing practical aspects of training neural networks.
* These iPython notebooks _occasionally_ have exercises.
* The concepts in the iPython notebooks are examinable.
* There will be videos of me going through the material in the pdf notes.  Where appropriate there _may_ also be videos of me going through the iPython notebooks.  These videos won't add anything to the underlying notes/notebooks.  So if you read + understand the notes / notebooks, the videos are optional.
 
## Feedback: 
* The main route for feedback is the labs/problem classes on Fridays 11-1 in MVB 1.11.  *These labs/problem classes are the primary route for feedback on all aspects of the course, including lectures, notes, questions, iPython notebooks, past exams and the group coursework!!!!*

## Exam (50% of total mark):
* These exams are in Christmas, and examine the taught material from TB1.
* I don't yet have confirmation on the exam format, but it will be 2 hours long.
* The exam is mainly based on theory/maths.  But material in the iPython notebooks will be examinable.  But the exam will be paper-based, so you won't actually need to do any coding.  For instance, you might have to spot a bug in a piece of code given by the question.  Or I might give some PyTorch code, and you might have to work out the shape of a tensor in that code.
* Things have changed quite alot since last year, so previous EMAT31530 exams are no longer relevant.
* I will post a practice exam once details are available.
* The exam will focus on the _concepts_ rather than requiring you to learn specific math equations / PyTorch functions.  So focus on understanding the underlying concepts, and don't worry too much about very low-level details.  Exactly what I mean by that will be more obvious once the practice exam is available.

## Group coursework (50% of total mark):
There will be a group coursework in TB2, which will run roughly for the first half of the teaching block.  Details are again not yet nailed down, and I will announce as soon as information is available.
